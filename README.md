# Phylocanvas.gl
A performant, reusable, and extensible tree visualisation library for the web, scaling to 100,000s of leaves. Documentation at [https://www.phylocanvas.gl/](https://www.phylocanvas.gl/).
 
Phylocanvas is primarily designed to be incorporated into CGPS software that display phylogenies. The scope of Phylocanvas is limited to the software tools of CGPS and, for this purpose, it is considered to be feature complete.
 
For bugs and suggestions, please raise an issue on <https://gitlab.com/cgps/phylocanvas/support>.
 
We provide this software as is, under [MIT license](https://gitlab.com/cgps/phylocanvas/phylocanvas.gl/-/blob/master/LICENSE), for the benefit and use of the community, however we are unable to provide support for its use or modification.
 
You are not granted rights or licenses to the trademarks of the CGPS or any party, including without limitation the Phylocanvas name or logo.
